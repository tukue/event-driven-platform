## 📈 Performance Testing

### Load Test
```bash
# Create 50 orders quickly
for i in {1..50}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/orders \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"pizza_name\":\"Test $i\",\"supplier_name\":\"Supplier\",\"supplier_price\":12.99}"
done

# Check dashboard performance
# Should load in < 2 seconds
```

### Cache Test
```bash
# First request (cache miss)
time curl http://localhost:8000/api/state

# Second request (cache hit, should be faster)
time curl http://localhost:8000/api/state

# Wait 6 seconds for cache expiry
sleep 6

# Third request (cache miss again)
time curl http://localhost:8000/api/state
```

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: Tests Fail with Connection Error
**Solution**: Make sure backend is running on port 8000
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

### Issue: Statistics Don't Update
**Solution**: Wait for cache to expire (5 seconds) or restart backend

### Issue: Drivers Not Appearing
**Solution**: Ensure order is dispatched (not just ready)

### Issue: WebSocket Not Connecting
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify backend WebSocket endpoint
