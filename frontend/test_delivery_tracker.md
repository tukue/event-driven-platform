# Delivery Tracker Integration Test Guide

## Tasks 18 & 19 Implementation Summary

### Task 18: WebSocket Integration ✅
- Added real-time WebSocket subscription to DeliveryTracker
- Listens for order-specific events (dispatched, in_transit, delivered)
- Automatically refetches delivery info when status changes
- Added live connection indicator (🟢 Live / ⚪ Offline)
- Handles connection errors gracefully

### Task 19: Main App Integration ✅
- Imported DeliveryTracker into App.jsx
- Added modal/overlay state management with `trackingOrderId`
- Added "Track Delivery" button to OrdersPanel for dispatched/in_transit/delivered orders
- Implemented open/close functionality

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
python main.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Create and Track an Order

1. **Create Order**: Use SupplierPanel to create a pizza order
2. **Accept Order**: Use CustomerPanel to accept the order
3. **Prepare Order**: Click "Start Preparing" → "Mark Ready"
4. **Dispatch Order**: Use DispatchPanel to assign a driver and dispatch
5. **Track Delivery**: Click the "🚚 Track Delivery" button in OrdersPanel

### 3. Verify Real-Time Updates

1. Open the Delivery Tracker modal
2. Check that the connection indicator shows "🟢 Live"
3. Update the order status (e.g., click "In Transit" button)
4. Verify the tracker updates automatically without closing/reopening
5. Watch the countdown timer update in real-time

### 4. Test Different States

**Dispatched State:**
- Progress shows: Dispatched (completed), In Transit (active), Delivered (pending)
- Driver card shows: "📍 Picking up order"
- ETA card displays estimated arrival time with countdown

**In Transit State:**
- Progress shows: Dispatched (completed), In Transit (completed), Delivered (active)
- Driver card shows: "🚗 On the way"
- ETA card continues counting down

**Delivered State:**
- Progress shows: All steps completed
- Driver card shows: "✅ Delivered"
- Delivered card replaces ETA card with delivery time

### 5. Test Error Handling

**Order Not Dispatched:**
- Try tracking an order in "preparing" or "ready" state
- Should show error: "Order not yet dispatched"

**Order Not Found:**
- Try tracking with invalid order ID
- Should show error: "Order not found"

**WebSocket Disconnection:**
- Stop the backend server
- Connection indicator should change to "⚪ Offline"
- Tracker should still display cached data
- Restart backend - should reconnect automatically
